Installation
============

The framework is available at the PyPi Repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U pyrecorder


Usage
=====

It's as simple as it should be. Initialize a `Recorder` object with a `Writer` and store plots by calling `record()`.

.. code-block:: bash

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    from pyrecorder.recorder import Recorder
    from pyrecorder.writers.video import Video

    # create a writer object (here, mp4)
    writer = Video("video.mp4")

    # use the with statement to close the recorder when done
    with Recorder(writer) as rec:

        # record 10 different snapshots
        for t in range(10):

            # create the plot (here, using matplotlib)
            X = np.random.random((50, 2))
            plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], facecolor="none", edgecolor="red")

            # use the record to store the current plot
            rec.record()
